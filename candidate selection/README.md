## Candidate Selection
Please run "bgfg generate v2.py" first to generate background and traffic mask. Then run "detect.sh" on generated background of all 100 videos with our pre-trained model. Run "candidate from yolo.py" to generate summary result from background detection result. Run "small object.py" on the rest of the videos to generate small object candidates.
